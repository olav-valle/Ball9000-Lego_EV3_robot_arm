/**
 * The main method, and Arbitrator for the RobotArm behaviors.
 *
 * Behaviors have priorities according to their index in the Behavior[]
 * from [0] (lowest), to [n] (highest) where n is last index of array.
 *
 * The behaviors in the array are continually queried by the Arbitrator (from highest
 * to lowest index) through their takeControl() methods.
 *
 * If a takeControl() method returns true, and the class has a higher priority index
 * than the currently active behavior, the new behavior is given control.
 *
 * If more than one behavior's takeControl() method returns true, the behavior with the highest
 * priority (array index) is given control.
 *
 * This executes the behavior's action() method. The action() method details the exact behavior
 * to be taken while it is in control.
 *
 * An action() method is kept active by a boolean variable (suppressed = false),
 * and should finish when suppressed = true.
 *
 * When the action() method finishes, it should put the robot in a safe state,
 * e.g. stop the motors, before control is relinquished back to the Arbitrator.
 *
 * The behavior will not relinquish control until either the action() method is finished,
 * or if the behavior's suppress() method is called.
 *
 * A behavior's suppress() method sets the behavior's boolean suppressed field to true,
 * which is the action() method's exit condition.
 *
 * Calling the suppress() method of the behavior that is currently in control should immediately and safely
